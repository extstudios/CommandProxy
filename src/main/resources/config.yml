# target-commands: List of specific commands to intercept
# Leave empty or remove this section to intercept ALL commands

target-commands: []
  # Example: Uncomment and add your commands here
  # - "warp"
  # - "home"
  # - "tpa"
  # - "spawn"
# If you want to intercept ALL commands, just leave the list empty like this:
# target-commands: []

# Or delete the target-commands section entirely
